# simple-online-bookstore-database
This is a simple online bookstore relational database project on SQLite for my database management system course.
We in group of four designed the whole database from ER digram. It is simple but contain nessary parts.

## File introduction:
`Part 1`:This folder contains answers specific related to questions for the database management course.<br>
`Part 2`:This folder contains the actual working database and csv files.<br>
`Database_ER Model.jpg`: This is the ER model we built for the book store database.<br>
`Database_Schema.jpg`: This is the schema we built based on ER modeland used for the book store database.<br>

## How to run the code:
1. Download the `DB broswer for sqlite` according to your computer version here: https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/
2. Open the DB broswer, click on `file` -> `open database`. Select `OnLineBookStore.sqlite` file under the folder `Part 2` in this repository.<br><br>
Now it is your time to play around with `execute SQL` tab in the broswer: <br>
Sample executable SQL with description on it, `Part 2` -> `SQL.txt` or `SQL INSERT_DELETE.txt`<br>
Also you could develop your own SQL to play around. 

## Enjoy!
