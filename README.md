# simple-online-bookstore-database
This is a simple online bookstore relational database project on SQLite for my database management system course.
We in group of four designed the whole database from ER digram. It is simple but contain nessary parts.

## How to run the code:
1. Download the `DB broswer for sqlite` according to your computer version here: https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/
2. Open the DB broswer, click on `file` -> `open database`. Select `OnLineBookStore.sqlite` file under the folder `Part 2` in this repository.
* Now it is your time to play around with `execute SQL` tab in the broswer: <br>
Sample executable SQL with description on it, also you could develop your own SQL to play around<br>
`Part 2` -> `SQL.txt` or `SQL INSERT_DELETE.txt`
* The relational database's ER diagram
